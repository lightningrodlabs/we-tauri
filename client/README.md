This package will contain typescript type definitions of all the types defined in the sensemaker-lite holochain backend, along with a `SensemakerStore` reactive object using Svelte stores to enable reactive and declarative bindings between your UI components and sensemaker data. Additionally, this package will include utility functions for you to easily create derived reactive state which is a composition of sensemaker state and your app (provider dna) state.

Currently compatible with holochain `v0.1.0`.
